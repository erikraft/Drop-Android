<h1 align="center">Support ErikrafT Drop for Android </h1>

<p align="center">This Android App is one of my hobby projects. If you want to support the app, you are more than welcomed to participate by submitting code contributions.</p>
<p align="center">If you relay on PairDrop in your daily life, you are welcome to support the community via a donation. This app causes quite some server load, so it's always good to get some server costs sponsored.</p>

ErikrafT Drop is libre, and always will be. \
If you find it useful and want to support free and open-source software, please consider donating using the button above. \
I footed the bill for the domain and the server, and you can help create and maintain great software by supporting me. \
Thank you very much for your contribution!
